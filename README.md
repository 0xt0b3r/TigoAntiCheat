### About TigoAntiCheat

AntiCheat by Tigo is a resource created for FiveM. This resource is to detect hackers and ban them from your server.

### Requirement
- None

### Get Started
In order to use this anticheat, all `esx:`, `esx_` etc. must be renamed.
The anticheat replaces `esx_...` server calls to perm bans.

Change e.g. `esx_drugs` to `tac_drugs` (only `EventHandlers`, `ClientEvents` and `ServerEvents`, leave resource folder just the orignal resource name example: `esx_drugs`).

### Disclamer
---
This resource was created by me with all the knowledge at the time of writing. It doesn't mean cheating becomes impossible. Updates will be done if there is time and reason to do so. The request of new functionality is allowed, but does not mean that it will be released.
